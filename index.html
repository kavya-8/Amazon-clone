AddPolynomials(A, B):
1. Initialize current1 to Node 1 of A (3x^3).
2. Initialize current2 to Node 1 of B (4x^2).
3. Initialize an empty result_poly.

4. While current1 is not NULL and current2 is not NULL:
   a. current1->exponent (3) > current2->exponent (2):
      - Add a new node to result_poly: coefficient = 3, exponent = 3.
      - Move current1 to Node 2 of A (2x^2).

   b. current1->exponent (2) == current2->exponent (2):
      - Calculate the sum of coefficients: sum_coeff = 2 (from A) + 4 (from B) = 6.
      - Add a new node to result_poly: coefficient = 6, exponent = 2.
      - Move current1 to Node 3 of A (5x^1) and current2 to Node 2 of B (3x^1).

   c. current1->exponent (1) > current2->exponent (1):
      - Add a new node to result_poly: coefficient = 5, exponent = 1.
      - Move current1 to Node 4 of A (1x^0).

   d. current1->exponent (0) == current2->exponent (0):
      - Calculate the sum of coefficients: sum_coeff = 1 (from A) + 2 (from B) = 3.
      - Add a new node to result_poly: coefficient = 3, exponent = 0.
      - Both current1 and current2 become NULL as they reach the end of their respective lists.

5. Since current1 is NULL, there are no remaining nodes in A.
6. Since current2 is NULL, there are no remaining nodes in B.

7. Return the head of result_poly, which represents the sum of the two polynomials.

Resultant Polynomial (sum of A and B):
- 3x^3 + 6x^2 + 5x^1 + 3x^0

Represented as a linked list:
- Node 1: coefficient = 3, exponent = 3
- Node 2: coefficient = 6, exponent = 2
- Node 3: coefficient = 5, exponent = 1
- Node 4: coefficient = 3, exponent = 0
